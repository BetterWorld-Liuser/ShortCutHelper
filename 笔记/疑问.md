# 如何给click one添加一个文件夹
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13656633/include-a-folder-in-clickonce-application
So Tom has explained how to add a file. You specifically say you would like to add a folder to your ClickOnce application once you publish it. Lets assume you have a folder sitting in the root of your solution named Dependencies which contains a folder Reports which contains all of your RPT files. Here is how you would make sure your deployed app contains all of the contents of the Dependencies folder:
Right click your project in Visual Studio and select "unload project".

Right click and select to edit the csproj file.

Before the closing </Project> tag add this:

  <ItemGroup>
    <Content Include="$(SolutionDir)Dependencies\**\*">
      <Link>%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)</Link>
      <Visible>false</Visible>
    </Content>
  </ItemGroup>

That will add everything from the Dependencies folder into the project. We are using the \**\* syntax at the end of the Include and %(RecursiveDir) to ensure the Reports folder will be present in the published version as well as the report files. Having set <Visible>false</Visible> you won't see the items cluttering up the solution explorer.
